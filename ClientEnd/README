INTRODUCTION
------------
The client end module is designed to provide the user with a graphical interface
capable of displaying telescope status and data on a local machine.
The client module will have to connect to a server side module to further connect
to the telescope. This module should be primarily written in python for simplicity.



STATUS
----------
The current status is test phase. Currently a simple command line with history is 
implemented via wxWidgets. Further visual modules are required.



RUNNING
---------

Execute via: python testWx.py&
