	The executable program is MCUTestCommTest. This program launches
	an NCurses terminal style GUI which provides low level 
	communication access to various telescope systems. The GUI is
	set up to provide an asynchonous command terminal interface
	along with user defined widgets (such as a hex viewer for packets).
	
	Implemented features: 
		- Terminal
			+ Generic Commands via Abstract Factory Paradigm
			+ Generic Arguments for Commands using glibc
			+ General Commands: list, help, history, clear, 
				            run, echo, quit
			+ Macro Script Functionality to execute a set of 
			  commands listed on each line of the script
		- TCP Connection 
			+ Packet send
			+ Packet Recv
		- TTY Connection (via serial port)
			+ Packet Send
			+ Packet Recv
			+ Front-End UART Packet Decode [WIP]
		- Hex Viewer 
			+ General byte block viewing (via char*)
			+ Packet Inspection
			+ Packet Decoding for Front-End UART [WIP]

	A simple script test.s has been added to configure the terminal
	to read Front-End TTY packets in the Raspberry Pi Environment.	

	To compile, use: make 

	Programs can be executed using the standard execution method ./ 
	Using the TTY serial functionality may require the user to either
	have sudo privledges or be listed on the dial-out group.
